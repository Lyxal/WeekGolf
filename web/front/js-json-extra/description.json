It is a historical language that has had a real importance on the programming world.\nAPL is the language that put forward the array-oriented paradigm (used by: A+, K, J, Julia, Matlab, R, Q), and of the use of mathematical notation in programming.\nThe basis of APL began to be developed in 1957, the same year that Fortran was published, at Harvard.\nIn 1960 he started to work for IBM, and it was there that Kenneth E. Iverson developed all the APL notation, and two years later he published the book \"A Programming Language\" where he developed the proximity between mathematical notation and computers.\n4 years later, in 1966, APL became public. It was revolutionary at first. APL used a ball or screen terminal instead of the punch card. Because of this and the mathematical concepts used in APL, it was increasingly successful until the mid-1980s.\nNowadays, APL is not used much anymore.",

Microsoft, which was interested in Java, bought, the following year, a license to propose an implementation of Java, which was called J++ (this is not related to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_(programming_language)\">J language</a>). However, in 1998, an American judge forbade Microsoft to use the Java trademark for J++ products because it did not respect the Java standard. As a result, two languages were created, J# and C#.\nJ# goes by quickly, however, C# does not, and that's where C# comes from.\nEven if C# was at the beginning very very similar to Java, the more time passed, then we see clearly the distinction of the two languages, even if they remain similar in some points.\nFor example, in 2008, in version 3 of C#, LINQ (Language INtegrated Queries) was added, which represents an advance quite different from Java. But more recently, in November 2021, for C#10, C# stopped being a class-based language and can now execute code without creating classes and main functions like in Java.\nThe name \"C#\" is inspired by the music notation where a hash indicates that the written note should be increased by a semitone. This is similar to the language name of C++, where \"++\" indicates that a variable should be incremented by 1 after being evaluated. The # symbol also looks like a ligature of four \"+\" symbols (in a two-by-two grid), which implies that the language is an increment of C++ and also of C.",

Miranda led to the creation of dozens of functional languages. Following this influx of functional languages, the people involved in this will form a committee to define the strengths of each language and to establish a standard for functional languages.\nAfter several years of consultation, in 1990 a consensus was reached and the language in question, Haskell, was created.\nHaskell has had several major versions changing the standars. After the first major version of Haskell in 1990, there was a big change in 1998 with a new standard for writing Haskell.\nThis version will have several changes, including a big one in 2003. However, there will be a new major standard that is still current today which is Haskell 2010.

The arrival of the J language created a split among APL users.
