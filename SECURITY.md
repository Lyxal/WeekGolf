## Introduction
At WeekGolf, we take the security of our software and users very seriously. We welcome and encourage responsible reporting of any vulnerabilities that may be found in our project.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability in our project, please report it to us as soon as possible by emailing tkirishima@proton.me. Please do not create a GitHub issue for the vulnerability, as this may expose the vulnerability to others.

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide as much information as possible, including:

- A detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Any proof-of-concept code or scripts that demonstrate the vulnerability
- Your contact information (so we can follow up with you if necessary)
- We will try to acknowledge your report within 48h and will work with you to verify and fix the vulnerability. We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the process.

## Known Security Issues
We are not currently aware of any security vulnerabilities in our project. If you believe you have discovered a vulnerability, please follow the reporting process outlined above.

## Updates and Patching
We are committed to addressing any security vulnerabilities in our project as quickly as possible. If a vulnerability is reported to us, we will work to verify and fix it as soon as possible. We will release patches or updates to our project as necessary to address any security issues that are discovered.
